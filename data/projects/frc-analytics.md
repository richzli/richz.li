FRC data analytics

An app I developed for my high school robotics team to calculate competing teams' stats.

---

The application was fully developed in **Python**. Libraries used include **tkinter** for the GUI, **urllib** for accessing the API, and **scipy** and **pandas** for the calculations.

I used **Scrum** to organize this project. Although the project was small, user stories were a great way for me to identify which parts of the application were important to develop first.
