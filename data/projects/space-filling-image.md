Traces an image along various space-filling curves.

This was my final project for MA 440, Honors Real Analysis. Inspired by discussions of cardinality, this program takes an image and traces it along three different space filling curves: the Hilbert curve, Z-order curve, and Peano curve.

A more detailed writeup of the mathematics behind the code can be found in the GitHub repository.
