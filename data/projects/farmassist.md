A combine harvester data visualizer made for the AITP Computing Challenge Day Fall 2020 and HackTX 2020.

---

This site was implemented in plain **Javascript** with the libraries **Leaflet.js** and **Chart.js**.

I participated in the Computing Challenge Day with two of my friends, and we were given seven hours to "simulate a combine harvesting a field".

We weren't given much time, so we settled on JS for its relative simplicity. This allowed us to focus on what we needed to make, rather than messing around with unfamiliar web frameworks.

I focused on collecting and cleaning up the data, converting it into a format which could be read by the website. [Kyle](https://github.com/zhengkyl) worked on the user interface, while [Pranav](https://github.com/pranandarao) implemented some extra features, like extrapolating with a custom path.

Divvying up the tasks this way allowed each of us to focus on our strengths and create a strong finished product, netting us first place in the coding challenge.
