            <p>This was coded in <strong>React Native</strong>, and we used <strong>Expo</strong> to test it on different types of devices. We used <strong>Firebase</strong> as the backend to store user info and messages.</p><br>

            <p>Being in a team of four meant that we had to clearly assign specific tasks to each person. Lots of finagling with <strong>Git</strong> was done.</p><br>

            <p>Before the hackathon, I hadn't coded in React at all, but it seemed like the best option to create a cross-platform app. Still, I was confident that I could learn it well enough to make a basic application.</p>

            <p>The original plan was to create an app for cooking food togetherâ€”each person brings a different ingredient. However, many of the features ended up not being implemented, partly because the one-day time limit was tight for a group of beginners, but also because we didn't focus on the right things.</p><br>

            <p>I in particular spent a lot of time getting a functional signup and login system working, but didn't realize that other features were more important. Although the end product wasn't what we expected to make, it was a good learning experience in project management and prioritizing tasks.</p>
