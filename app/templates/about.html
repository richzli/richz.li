                    Most people feel like they have impostor syndrome, but I feel that it's always beneficial to be completely confident in yourself, and truly believe you can solve any challenge in front of you. At my first ever internship, I excelled in the role, designing, building, and presenting a much-needed developer tool within 11 weeks. I learned quite a bit about cloud technologies, particularly AWS, as well as becoming more comfortable working with a team and rifling through arcane documentation.

                    The biggest perk of being a leader is that people will listen to what you're passionate about. I revived the old competitive programming club to promote interest in the sport, holding practices and lectures on a regular basis. I also continued participating in ctfs and assisting the club in its operations. While taking on these roles was quite draining, I am invested in making an impact in the subjects I love.

                    Being on the opposite side of the lecture hall helped me broaden my perspectives. From a semester and a summer of teaching my own class, I learned much about the importance of communicating ideas clearly and being open to new technologies. Afterwards, I continued on in a more managerial role, getting to see just how much work is put into running a class smoothly. I'm proud that I've able to use my skills to guide this course along for multiple years.
